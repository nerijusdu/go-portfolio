# Map-it

This is a PWA project management tool with a cool UI (at least for my standards). It was a playground to try out all the shiny new things and technologies. This project got my personal award for being the longest ongoing side-project of mine (UPDATE: not anymore, check out [Save My Bank](/projects/save-my-bank)). I don't feel like working on this "masterpiece" anymore, but who knows, maybe I'll think of something else to add after another year or so.
