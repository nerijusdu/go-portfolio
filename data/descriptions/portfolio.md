# Portfolio

This is my portfolio where I post details about my side projects and maybe I'll write some blogs too, who knows ðŸ¤·.

## Tech stack

This is a simple [GO](https://go.dev) web application built using [Chi](https://go-chi.io) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Details

This is a simple application that renders html templates and populates them with data from YAML or Markdown files.


For example, all the projects in [Projects](/projects) page are read from YAML file, and this project details page is read from a Markdown file.
